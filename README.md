Pixels-to-Prognosis
The goal for this project is to train a machine learning model on a set of chest x-ray images containing healthy patients, patients infected with bacterial pneumonia, and patients infected with viral pneumonia, to be able to identify positive cases and eventually distinguish between the two types of infections.

All machine learning in this project was done using the Keras API for TensorFlow and performed in Google Colaboratory.

Images used in this project were obtained from Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/data
